// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

variable num1
variable num2
Sum = num1 + num2



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
 
variable num1
if(num%2 == 0)
print Even
else 
print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
Enter num1,num2, num3,num4,num5
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
Average = (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5) / 5
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
minimum = compare num1,num2,num3,num4,num5
print smallest 
maximum = compare num1,num2,num3,num4,num5
print largest

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Average, smallest and largest
